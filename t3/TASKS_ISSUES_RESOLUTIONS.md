# BigANN Challenge Tasks, Issues, and Resolutions

In the spirit of maintaining a fair and open competition, we will be tracking all important remaining tasks and issues, and their respective resolution - and making that all public here on this README.  All competition rankings and winners will be "unofficial" until all tasks and issues have been resolved.

Participants should send their questions and issues to the T3 organizer directly (gwilliams@gsitechnology.com), or to the competition google group at big-ann-organizers@googlegroups.com.  Note that some issues may require a complete re-evaluation of an algorithm on its respective hardware, or may require additional information from a participant or competition organizer(s).

## Tasks (open)

* [T3 Organizer] Currently reported DiskANN results may be using an old version of recall computation (ie, not accounting for ties).
* [T3 Organizer] Currently, DiskANN cannot qualify for power and cost benchmarks due to issue with running IPMICAP ( python ipmi in particular seems to be the issue. )
* [GSI] New index for SSNPP and Text2Image requires re-evaluation for those datasets and updated scores.
* [GSI] Need better documentation for how to extract power benchmark from plot.py script.

## Issues (open)

* [Intel] Why won't there be one winner for T3 that combines all individual benchmarks?
* [GSI] We cannot reproduce the baseline performance on SSNPP on same/similar hardware.

## Resolutions

None
